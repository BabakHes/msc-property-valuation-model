Abstract

The aim of this project was application-oriented in that it set out to create a valuation model to serve a business purpose with input from industry experts. 
A mixed approach was adopted combining qualitative (in-depth interviews) and quantitative (predictive models) data generation and analysis methods. 
Two objectives were defined: 
Can the use of alternative data sources improve or match the price and rental prediction models in a property investment appraisal context? 
and How can the use of alternative data sources impact, and potentially benefit, the industry experts who use property appraisal tools?. The interview 
themes were usability, predictive power, and explainability. 

These were address by building robust models using XGBoost algorithm, which was trained and tested with alternative data sources (not price-paid). 

The models predict the price and the rent for a given full postcode in the London Borough of Lambeth (predictive power). 

The best performing models were used in a prototype of an appraisal system. In the front-end, the features that were used in the model training 
were ranked and scored in order of their contribution to the prediction (explainability). The metrics displayed put the investment opportunity 
into context for the appraiser (usability). Creating more explainable tools for industry experts requires their participation in the development 
of those tools.
